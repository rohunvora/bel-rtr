# Belief Router — One Pager

## What
Keyboard-first trading interface for crypto perps. Type your trade in plain English, execute in <2 seconds.

## Why Now
- Perp volume exploding (HL doing $5B+/day)
- Existing UIs are clunky (10+ clicks per trade)
- Traders want speed, not tutorials
- We have distribution (400k followers) + technical chops (Phantom exit)

## How It Works
```
Cmd+K → "sol long 10k 2x" → Enter → Done
```

## Core Features (V1)
1. **Keyboard execution** — Trade in 2 seconds, not 20
2. **Position dashboard** — All positions, one-click actions
3. **Pair trades** — Long SOL / Short ETH as one position
4. **Baskets** — "Solana ecosystem" = weighted multi-asset exposure
5. **Quick actions** — Flip, double down, close half, close all

## What Makes It Defensible
- Speed (10x faster than alternatives)
- Strategies you can't easily do elsewhere (pairs, baskets)
- Distribution moat (launch to 400k followers)
- Copy trading network effects (later)

## Business Model
- Trading fees: 0.01-0.05% of volume
- Premium tier: $20-50/mo for advanced features
- Copy trading fees (later)

## Target Metrics (Month 3)
- 5,000 DAU
- $50M daily volume
- $750k monthly revenue

## Timeline
- Week 1-2: Core keyboard execution, private alpha
- Week 3-4: Pairs, baskets, mobile, public beta
- Month 2: Analytics, conditionals, public launch
- Month 3+: Copy trading, growth features

## The Team
- [You]: 400k Twitter, multi-million $ trader, crypto-native distribution
- [Co-founder]: Built trading terminal acquired by Phantom

## The Ask
Building in public. Launching to our audience. Will raise after PMF.
